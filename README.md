Online service helps to exchange ideas between team members and perform a brainstorming process visually using Dashboard.

**Problem**: 
When working on a project, the team needs to perform a brainstorming process between all members to get new ideas and get the best results without wasting time to organize the process and effort to do that.

**Solution**:
This service provides a platform for exchanging ideas between the team and doing brainstorm process.

**Simplified cases**: 

- A team manager wants his way to collect the best ideas from all the team members, register them within the service and start working on a specific idea.

- The teacher wants to get the best students ’ideas on a specific topic for adoption during the teaching process, so he asks them to do a brainstorming process for these ideas.
